## Abstract

Remarkable progress has been made in automated problem solving through societies of agents based  on  large  language  models  (LLMs).  Computational  fluid  dynamics  (CFD),  as  a  complex problem, presents unique challenges in automated simulations that require sophisticated solutions. MetaOpenFOAM,  as  a  novel  multi-agent  collaborations  framework,  aims  to  complete  CFD simulation  tasks  with  only  natural  language  as  input. These  simulation  tasks  include  mesh  preprocessing,  simulation  and  post-processing,  etc.  MetaOpenFOAM  harnesses  the  power  of MetaGPT's  assembly  line  paradigm,  which  assigns  diverse  roles  to  various  agents,  efficiently breaking  down  complex  CFD  tasks  into  manageable  subtasks.  Langchain  further  complements MetaOpenFOAM  by  integrating  Retrieval-Augmented  Generation  (RAG)  technology,  which enhances the framework's ability by integrating a searchable database of OpenFOAM tutorials for LLMs. Tests  on  a  benchmark  for  natural  language-based  CFD  solver,  consisting  of  eight  CFD simulation tasks, have shown that MetaOpenFOAM achieved a high pass rate per test (85%), with each test case costing only $0.22 on average. The eight CFD simulation tasks encompass a range of multidimensional flow problems, covering compressible and incompressible flows with different physical  processes  such  as  turbulence,  heat  transfer  and  combustion.  This  demonstrates  the capability to automate CFD simulations using only natural language input, iteratively correcting errors to achieve the desired simulations at a low cost. An ablation study was conducted to verify the necessity of each component in the multi-agent system and the RAG technology. A sensitivity study on the randomness of LLM showed that LLM with low randomness can obtain more stable and accurate results. Additionally, MetaOpenFOAM owns the ability to identify and modify key parameters in user requirements, excels in correcting bugs when failure match occur, and enhances simulation  capabilities  through  human  participation,  which  demonstrates  the  generalization  of MetaOpenFOAM.

## 1. Introduction

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a discipline that uses numerical methods and physical models  to  solve  fluid  mechanics  problems  [1].  Since  the  introduction  of  CFD,  scientists  and engineers have employed complex code to simulate and predict fluid behavior, with open-source software like OpenFOAM being a notable and mature example [2]. Although OpenFOAM has been successfully  applied  in  many  fields  [3-6],  it  still  requires  researchers  to  possess  high-level programming and specialized skills. As technology progresses, automated tools and user-friendly interfaces have emerged, allowing users to perform complex CFD simulations with simply clicking buttons on GUI, leading to the development of industrial software like Fluent [7] and COMSOL [8]. However, even with these improvements, conducting CFD simulations remains highly technical, requiring specialized knowledge and substantial manual operations. Recently, the rapid advancement of natural language processing (NLP) technologies, particularly the advent of large language model (LLM) [9-14], has brought new hope to CFD research, promising to revolutionize the field.

The emergence of LLM represents a significant breakthrough in natural language processing. LLM can understand and generate natural language, handling vast  amounts of  information and providing  intelligent  feedback.  Recent  advancements,  such  as  GPT-4  [15],  Llama  2  [16],  and ChatGLM [17], have demonstrated powerful capabilities in tasks like translation, text generation, and question-answering. However, despite their impressive performance in many tasks, single LLM still face limitations in solving complex problems requiring extensive text generation [10, 13, 14, 18-20].  For  example,  CFD  problems  typically  involve  intricate  geometric  modeling,  physical modeling, and numerical methods, which exceed the current capabilities of individual LLM. To harness the potential of LLM in the CFD field, new approaches are needed to enhance their ability to tackle complex problems.

To address the limitations of single LLM in solving complex problems, the development of Multi-Agent System (MAS) has emerged as a promising approach [9-14, 20]. MAS involves the collaboration of multiple intelligent agents to complete complex tasks, with each agent focusing on different  sub-tasks  or  domains,  thereby  improving  the  overall  system's  efficiency  and  accuracy. Notably, MAS can achieve unsupervised adversarial generation by iteratively having certain agents evaluate the text generated by other agents, helping refine and enhance the precision of the generated text to better meet user requirements. In CFD simulation tasks, MAS can assign different agents to handle CFD task division, input file writing, CFD simulation, and simulation result evaluation. The evaluating agents can provide feedback to other agents, optimizing their outputs. Once implemented, this natural language-based MAS approach to CFD simulation can significantly lower the barrier to conduct  CFD  simulations  and  reduce  the  workload  for  researchers,  making  CFD  studies  more efficient and accessible.

Currently, various LLM-based tools have been developed to facilitate the collaboration and integration of multi-agent systems. MetaGPT [11] and Langchain [21] are two notable tools in this field. MetaGPT is a framework designed for multi-agent collaboration, enabling the coordination of multiple LLM agents to tackle complex CFD problems. Through MetaGPT, researchers can chain different  LLM  agents  together,  each  playing  a  specific  role,  to  accomplish  tasks  collectively. Langchain, on the other hand, is a tool for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology. By effectively  integrating  information  from  multiple  documents,  Langchain  can  provide  more professional support for CFD research. Building on the MetaGPT and Langchain frameworks, this paper develops MetaOpenFOAM,  a natural language-based CFD  simulation framework. MetaOpenFOAM takes user requirements as input, generates OpenFOAM input files through LLM, and returns simulation results that meet user requirements after automatically running OpenFOAM.

The structure of this paper is as follows: first, the basic framework of MetaOpenFOAM and the implementation method of RAG are introduced. Next, a series of test datasets and evaluation methods for CFD simulations with natural language input are presented. Following this, the results of  MetaOpenFOAM  are  quantitatively  introduced,  along  with  an  ablation  study  and  parameter sensitivity analysis. Finally, the results of MetaOpenFOAM are qualitatively analyzed.

## 2. Methodology

## 2.1 MetaOpenFOAM Framework

As  shown  in  Figure  1,  MetaOpenFOAM  is  architected  to  interpret  user  requirements, decompose  them  into  manageable  subtasks,  and  execute  these  subtasks  through  a  series  of specialized  agents.  The  framework  leverages  the  MetaGPT  assembly  line  paradigm  to  assign distinct roles to each agent, ensuring efficient task execution and error handling.

The  framework  is  divided  into  four  primary  roles,  each  with  specific  responsibilities  and actions:

Architect (Role) :  This  role  is  responsible  for  the  initial  interpretation  of  the  user's  natural language  requirements.  The Architect  converts  user  requirements  into  a  specified  format,  finds similar cases from the database, creates the input architecture, and oversees the overall workflow to ensure that the user's specifications are accurately translated into actionable tasks.

## Actions of Architect :

Find similar cases in the database of OpenFOAM cases and tutorials.

Create the input architecture according to the similar case.

InputWriter (Role) : The InputWriter role focuses on generating and refining the necessary input  files  for  the  CFD  simulation.  This  involves  writing  initial  input  files,  rewriting  them  as necessary  based  on  feedback  or  errors,  and  ensuring  that  all  files  conform  to  OpenFOAM's requirements.

## Actions of InputWriter :

Write input files for OpenFOAM based on the architecture provided by the Architect.

Rewrite input files for OpenFOAM if modifications or corrections are needed.

Runner (Role) : The Runner executes the CFD simulation using OpenFOAM. This role ensures that the simulation runs smoothly and monitors for any possible errors during execution.

## Actions of Runner :

Write the Allrun script to automate the simulation execution process.

Run the Allrun script to perform the CFD simulation.

Reviewer (Role) : The Reviewer's role is to analyze any errors that occur during the simulation, identify the relevant file that caused the error, and report these findings back to the InputWriter. This role is to check the file architecture based on existing information to determine whether the error is caused by the absence of related files or the incorrect contents that need modifications.

## Actions of Reviewer :

Review the input architecture.

Review error context.

## Procedure of MetaOpenFOAM

First, the Architect takes the user requirements and splits them into several subtasks, which are then given to the InputWriter. The InputWriter creates the necessary OpenFOAM input files and passes  them  to  the  Runner.  The  Runner  writes  the Allrun  script  and  executes  the  OpenFOAM simulation. If an error occurs, the Runner provides the execution error command and error context to the Reviewer. The Reviewer examines the file architecture and context to identify and solve the error, then returns the revised instructions to the InputWriter. The InputWriter either writes new files following the revised architecture or corrects the error in the input files. This loop repeats until no errors occur, or it reaches a user-defined maximum number of iterations or maximum investment (based on tokens). The prompts of the main action in each role are shown in Appendix A.

## 2.2 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based on Langchain

Langchain's  RAG  technology  is  a  critical  component  that  supports  MetaOpenFOAM  by integrating  a  searchable  database  of  OpenFOAM  official  documents  and  tutorials.  This  system enhances the agents' ability to perform their tasks by providing relevant information and contextual guidance, ensuring that the framework can handle a wide range of CFD scenarios with minimal user intervention.

Figure 2. The procedure of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

<!-- image -->

Figure  2  shows  the  procedure  of  RAG  in  action  'Find  similar  case'  of  MetaOpenFOAM. Firstly,  based  on  the  tutorials  provided  by  OpenFOAM,  a  database  containing  file  structures  is constructed.  These  documents  are  then  split  into  chunks.  Each  individual  case  is  divided  into separated chunks. A vector store is then created using these chunks. After saving the database, it only requires querying to retrieve the most similar chunks. These chunks are then combined with the user message as input for the LLM, completing the entire RAG process. And for other actions of MetaOpenFOAM, the procedure of RAG is similar, and only the database should be changed into file  context  or  file  command,  corresponding  to  the  OpenFOAM  tutorials  and  OpenFOAM commands in Figure 1.  During  the  actions  "Write  input  OpenFOAM  files"  and  "Rewrite  input OpenFOAM files," documents containing tutorial file contents are required. For the action "Write the Allrun  file,"  documents  containing  the  collection  of  OpenFOAM  execution  commands  are needed to ensure that the written commands comply with the standards. Specific examples of these documents can be found in Appendix B.

The more detailed document segmentation facilitates more accurate matching during retrieval. The necessity of the above data-enhanced retrieval (RAG) method will be validated in Section 4.1.

## 3. Experiment

## 3.1 Setup

MetaGPT v0.8.0 [11] was selected to integrate various LLMs, while OpenFOAM 10 [2] was utilized for CFD computations due to its stability and reliability as an open-source CFD solver. GPT4o  [15]  was  chosen  as  the  representative  LLM  because  of  its  outstanding  performance.  The temperature, as a parameter of LLM controlling randomness of generated text, was set to 0.01 to ensure highly focused and deterministic outputs, which results in low randomness of the generated text. The influence of temperature on performance is evaluated in Section 4.2.

For RAG technology, LangChain v0.1.19 [21] was employed to link the LLM and the database. The FAISS vector store [22], known for its efficiency and user-friendliness, was used as the database vector store, and OpenAIEmbeddings were selected for embedding the data chunks. The 'similarity' method was utilized for matching similar chunks. The combination of retrieved documents and user messages  represents  the  simplest  form  of  stacking.  More  details  could  be  found  in  the  code: https://github.com/Terry-cyx/MetaOpenFOAM

## 3.2 Benchmarking Natural Language Input for CFD Solvers

Currently, there are no public benchmarks for CFD user requirements to validate CFD solvers that  take  natural  language  as  input.  Therefore,  this  paper  derives  several  common  simulation requirements from OpenFOAM tutorials and lists several relevant simulations needs.

It  is  important  to  note  that,  from  the  user's  perspective,  natural  language-based  CFD  user requirements are generally incomplete. They cannot cover all the necessary information required for input files and can only provide the most essential details, such as the case name, case category, solver, mesh, boundary conditions, and initial conditions. Therefore, in the constructed cases below, only partial information is provided as user requirements, aligning with the usage habits of natural language.

Eight cases, covering a range of multidimensional flow problems including both 2D and 3D flows,  various  compressible  and  incompressible  flows  with  various  physical  processes  such  as turbulence,  heat  transfer,  and  combustion,  were  tested.  These  cases  involve  Direct  Numerical Simulation (DNS) and the turbulence models of Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES). Both compressible and incompressible solvers are included, along with  description  for  Newtonian  and  non-Newtonian  fluids. All  these  cases  were  modified  from OpenFOAM tutorials, with specific parameters adjusted accordingly.

- ① HIT: do a DNS simulation of incompressible forcing homogeneous isotropic turbulence with Grid 32^3 using dnsFoam
- ② PitzDaily: do a LES simulation of incompressible pitzDaily flow using pisoFoam with inlet velocity = 5 m/s
- ③ Cavity: do a 2D RANS simulation of incompressible cavity flow using pisoFoam, with RANS model: RNGkEpsilon, grid 15*15*1
- ④ LidDrivenCavity: do an incompressible lid driven cavity flow simulation with the top wall moves in the x direction at a speed of 1 m/s while the other three are stationary
- ⑤ SquareBendLiq: do a compressible simulation of squareBendLiq of using rhoSimpleFoam with endTime = 100, deltaT = 1, and writeInterval = 10
- ⑥ PlanarPoiseuille: do a laminar simulation of incompressible planar Poiseuille flow of a nonNewtonian fluid with grid 1*20*1, modelled using the Maxwell viscoelastic laminar stress model, initially at rest, constant pressure gradient applied from time zero
- ⑦ CounterFlowFlame: do a 2D laminar simulation of counterflow flame using reactingFoam in combustion with grid 50*20*1
- ⑧ BuoyantCavity:  do  a  RANS  simulation  of  buoyantCavity  using  buoyantFoam,  which investigates natural convection in a heat cavity with a temperature difference of 20K is maintained between the hot and cold; the remaining patches are treated as adiabatic.

## 3.3 Evaluation Metrics

It is essential to establish evaluation metrics to assess the performance of natural languagebased CFD solvers. These metrics need to consider common indicators in the CFD domain, such as successful mesh generation and convergence of calculations, as well as computational costs and generation success rates (pass@k in [23]) relevant to the LLM domain. Therefore, we evaluate the practical performance of natural language-based CFD solvers using the following five metrics: the first four metrics A, B, C, D for single experiments and the last metric E being added for multiple experiments.

Single experiments can be evaluated by the following metrics:

(A) Executability : This metric rates input files on a scale from 0 (failure) to 4 (flawless). A score of '0' indicates grid generation failure, '1' indicates grid generation success but running failure, '2' indicates that the case is runnable but does not converge, '3' indicates that the case runs to the endTime specified in the controlDict, and '4' indicates flawless input foam files, which not only run to the endTime but also meet all user requirements. A single experiment is considered to have passed the test if its executability score reaches '4'. Among them, '1' to '3' can be judged automatically by the program, but '4' requires human participation.

(B) Cost : The cost evaluation includes (1) running time, (2) number of iterations, (3) token usage, and (4) expenses, which are proportional to token usage.

(C) Code Statistics : This metric includes (1) the number of input files, (2) the number of lines per input file, and (3) the total number of lines in the input files.

(D) Productivity : This metric is defined as the number of tokens used divided by the number of lines in the input files, representing token consumption per input line.

For multiple experiments, a new metric needs to be added:

(E) Pass@k [23]: This metric represents the probability that at least one of the k generated input file samples passes the unit tests. It measures the model's ability to generate correct input files within k attempts. We follow the unbiased version of pass@k as presented by Chen et al. (2021a) and Dong et al. (2023) to evaluate the pass@k of MetaOpenFOAM

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where 𝑛 represents the number of input sets generated for each user requirement, and 𝑐 represents the number of these samples that pass the test, i.e., achieve an executability score of 4. To evaluate pass@k, we generate 𝑛 ≥ 𝑘 samples per task (with 𝑛 = 10 and 𝑘 = 1 in this paper), count the number of correct samples 𝑐 ≤ 𝑛 which pass unit tests, and calculate the unbiased estimator.

Table 1 presents the performance of MetaOpenFOAM on eight test cases from the benchmark proposed in Section 3.2. The complete flow chart for the individual examples is described in detail in Appendix C,  using  HIT  as  an  example.  Only  a  selection  of  key  metrics  from  Section  3.3  is displayed, while the rest are provided in Appendix D. Each metric for single experiments is the average of n tests (n=10). For the iteration metric in the cost, maximum iteration is set to 20 in the program to prevent infinite iterations. If executability does not reach 3 or above after 20 iterations, the test is automatically marked as failed and the iteration is terminated.

Overall, the average pass rate (pass@1) of 85% and high executability score 3.6 demonstrate the outstanding performance of MetaOpenFOAM. On average, each test case requires 44,045 tokens. Given a cost of $5 per 1M tokens, generating one test case costs only $0.22, and each line of input file consumes an average of 67.1 tokens, costing just $0.0003, which is significantly lower than manual labor costs. Therefore, in terms of lowering the barrier to use, reducing labor costs, and increasing efficiency, MetaOpenFOAM is revolutionary.

For different test cases, it can be seen that HIT, PitzDaily, Cavity, and SquareBendLiq have an executability score of 4, meaning flawless results that satisfy all user requirements. These cases require fewer iterations and fewer tokens. However, for cases with lower executability scores, such as BuoyantCavity and LidDrivenCavity, the LLM fails to correctly modify errors, resulting in more iterations and higher token usage, and consequently, a lower pass@1.

Analyzing the correlation between iteration and token usage, we find a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.89 with a p-value of 0.0013. This indicates a strong positive correlation between iteration and token usage, and this correlation is statistically significant (p-value much less than 0.05).  The  reason  is  evident:  more  iterations  mean  more  input  to  the  LLM.  Therefore,  in  the subsequent discussion, we will focus only on iteration and not token usage, due to their strong correlation.

As shown in Figure 3, we visualized MetaOpenFOAM's contour plots for eight test examples using paraview [24]. Detailed results about performance and test examples are provided in Appendix D.

## 4. Discussion

This  section  will  discuss  the  necessity  of  each  component  in  MetaOpenFOAM  as  well  as sensitivity analysis of key parameters related to large language models and qualitative analysis of some MetaOpenFOAM results.

## 4.1 Ablation Analysis

To  validate  the  necessity  of  each  component  in  MetaOpenFOAM,  we  removed  some components to quantitatively discuss how their removal influences the model outputs. Specifically, since MetaOpenFOAM primarily consists of Roles, Actions, and RAG, the ablation study focused on these three aspects.

## A. Remove 'Reviewer' Role

As shown in section 2.1, there are 4 roles in MetaOpenFOAM where the Architect, InputWriter, and Runner are essential roles. Removing any of these would result in an executability of 0, making ablation  analysis  meaningless.  However,  the  Reviewer  is  not  strictly  necessary,  allowing  for comparison with and without it. It is important to note that the Reviewer is the key component of MetaOpenFOAM that distinguishes automated multi-agent collaboration from a simple aggregation of single agents. Therefore, examining how the Reviewer affects model outputs is vital.

## B. Remove 'Review architecture' Action

Each role involves several actions. Some actions, like creating the input architecture, writing OpenFOAM input  files,  and  running  OpenFOAM,  are  essential.  Omitting  these  actions  would obviously prevent the tests from passing. Therefore, we only considered the non-essential action of 'Review architecture'. If 'Review architecture' is missing, errors related to wrong file architecture become difficult to resolve.

## C. Remove RAG

RAG  technology  is  another  key  component  of  MetaOpenFOAM,  providing  professional knowledge  missing  from  general  LLMs.  To  verify  the  importance  of  RAG,  we  tested  the performance of MetaOpenFOAM without it.

Table 2: The ablation study on role, action and RAG. '#' denotes 'Remove', '#Reviewer' means remove Reviewer, '#Nothing' means remove nothing, i.e., the complete and original MetaOpenFOAM, 'Arc.' denotes the input architecture.

| Statistical Index                              |   #Reviewer |   #Review Arc. |    #RAG |   #Nothing |
|------------------------------------------------|-------------|----------------|---------|------------|
| (A) Executability                              |         1.7 |            3   |     0.8 |        3.6 |
| (B) Cost: Running time (s)                     |       126   |          292   |   332   |      271   |
| (B) Cost: Iteration (max: 20)                  |         0   |            7.7 |    19.2 |        5.7 |
| (B) Cost: Token Usage                          |     15661   |        69336   | 81346   |    44045   |
| (C) Code Statistic: Input Files                |        12.8 |           13.2 |    10.1 |       13.7 |
| (C) Code Statistic: Lines per                  |        42   |           42.5 |   124.5 |       49.9 |
| (C) Code Statistic: Total lines of Input Files |       540   |          572   |  1491   |      760   |
| (D) Productivity                               |        29.8 |          143   |   158.2 |       67.1 |
| (E) pass@1 (%)                                 |        27.5 |           70   |     0   |       85   |

Table 2 shows the performance of MetaOpenFOAM when the Reviewer (role), Review input architecture (action), RAG, or nothing is removed. After removing the Reviewer role, the pass@1 of MetaOpenFOAM dropped from 85% to 27.5%. Without the Reviewer, no iterations occurred, resulting in lower running time and cost. However, the significantly lower pass@1 and executability indicate a substantial decline in MetaOpenFOAM's applicability and utility. As shown in Figure 4, apart from the cavity and squareBendLiq cases, which require no iterations, all other cases failed. This demonstrates that without the Reviewer role, MetaOpenFOAM cannot handle CFD simulation tasks with moderate complexity. When the 'Review architecture' action was removed, the pass@1 also decreased from 85% to 70%. This decline mainly stemmed from the HIT and LidDrivenCavity cases, where file architecture-related errors (for example, "cannot find file XX") occurred. Without the  'Review  architecture'  action,  MetaOpenFOAM  could  not  create  a  new  file  architecture  to resolve  these  issues,  resulting  in  repeated  modifications  to  existing  files.  Thus,  the  'Review architecture' action is verified as necessary.

For the RAG module, another key component of MetaOpenFOAM, removing RAG resulted in a pass@1 of 0, indicating that MetaOpenFOAM without RAG could not pass any CFD simulation tasks  in  the  database.  However,  executability  was  not  0  because  some  simulation  tasks  could complete  mesh  generation  (Executability=1),  run  but  not  converge  (Executability=2),  or  run successfully but not meet user requirements (Executability=3). For instance, in the PitzDaily test, MetaOpenFOAM without RAG could even achieve an executability of 3, but the simulated case used a randomly generated 20*20*20 cubic mesh instead of the PitzDaily mesh. This shows that without RAG, MetaOpenFOAM loses the ability to complete CFD simulation tasks, likely due to the lack of training data for constructing OpenFOAM input files in LLM.

Detailed data for the entire ablation study are presented in table form in Appendix E.

## 4.2 Influence of parameter 'temperature'

In LLM, the 'temperature' is a key parameter, which controls the randomness and creativity of the generated text. When the temperature is high (for example near 1), the probability distribution becomes flatter, making the model more likely to choose words with less probability. The generated text becomes more diverse and creative, but it may also be less coherent or sensible. When  the temperature is low (for example near 0), the probability distribution becomes sharper, making the model  more  likely  to  choose  the  most  probable  words.  The  generated  text  becomes  more conservative and coherent but less diverse and creative.

Table 3 shows the average evaluation metrics after running the database of test cases 10 times at three different temperatures (0.01, 0.5, 0.99). It is evident that when the temperature is set to 0.01, both (A) Executability and (B) Cost, as well as (D) Productivity and (E) pass@1, are optimal on average.  This  suggests  that  conservative  and  coherent  generated  text  leads  to  more  stable  and accurate results.

Figure 5 shows the average pass@1 for the eight test cases under three different temperatures

(0.01, 0.5, 0.99). We found that for most case, lower temperature leads to higher pass@1 due to the more stable and accurate generated inputs. However, for a few cases, such as LidDrivenCavity and BuoyantCavity,  a  middle  temperature  (temperature=0.5)  achieved  better  pass@1  than  the  low temperature (temperature=0.01). But high temperature (temperature = 0.99) results in low pass@1 in all the test dataset, which means that LLM with high temperature is not suitable for CFD tasks solving.

Figure 6 Average iterations for different CFD experiments with 3 different temperatures of LLM

<!-- image -->

Figure 6 illustrates the average iterations for eight test cases under three different temperatures (0.01, 0.5, 0.99). Each iteration requires running the InputWriter, Runner, and Reviewer. Iterations is a cost metric for MetaOpenFOAM, which correlates positively with tokens and expenses. For most cases, lower temperature leads to lower iterations due to the more stable and accurate generated inputs. However, for a few cases like LidDrivenCavity and BuoyantCavity, very low randomness (temperature=0.01) led to overly sharp probability distributions, resulting in repeated errors during iterations. In contrast, moderate randomness (temperature=0.5) helped overcome the fixed patterns of errors produced at low temperatures, reducing the number of iterations and thereby lowering tokens and expenses.

Therefore, a dynamic temperature model might be beneficial. It could dynamically adjust from low to middle temperatures when low-temperature generation is ineffective, improving pass rates and reducing costs in MetaOpenFOAM.

## 4.3 Generalizability Study

In  this  section,  we  will  qualitatively  analyze  the  performance  of  MetaOpenFOAM  in  some special situations such as the ones requiring modification of key parameters, matching with less similar cases, or requiring human participation to improve performance.

## A. Key data identification and modification

One of the most important capabilities in a natural language based CFD simulation framework is the ability to identify changes to key data in the user requirement and modify those changes when writing the input file. This capability is the foundation of CFD numerical optimization based on natural language and is a key differentiator from executability 3 to 4 in evaluation metrics.

Key data can be divided into two categories. One is can be directly corrected in the input, such as  grid  size,  model  parameters,  and  control  parameters;  the  other  category  cannot  be  directly modified in the input, such as the Reynolds number.

For key data that can be directly corrected in the input, MetaOpenFOAM can identify and modify the corresponding parameters in the input. Here lists the dataset where the key data changed:

- ① HIT: do a DNS simulation of incompressible forcing homogeneous isotropic turbulence with Grid 20^3 using dnsFoam. [32-&gt;20]
- ② PitzDaily: do a LES simulation of incompressible pitzDaily flow using pisoFoam with inlet velocity = 8 m/s. [5-&gt;8]
- ③ Cavity: do a 2D RANS simulation of incompressible cavity flow using pisoFoam, with RANS model: KEpsilon, grid 15*15*1. [RNGkEpsilon-&gt; KEpsilon]
- ④ LidDrivenCavity: do an incompressible lid driven cavity flow simulation with the top wall moves in the x direction at a speed of 2 m/s while the other 3 are stationary. [1-&gt;2]
- ⑤ SquareBendLiq: do a compressible simulation of squareBendLiq of using rhoSimpleFoam with endTime = 1000, deltaT = 1, and writeInterval = 100. [100-&gt;1000, 10-&gt;100]
- ⑥ PlanarPoiseuille:  do  a  laminar  simulation of  incompressible  planar Poiseuille  flow of  a Newtonian fluid with grid 1*20*1, initially at rest, constant pressure gradient applied from time zero. [non-Newtonian -&gt; Newtonian]
- ⑦ CounterFlowFlame: do a 2D laminar simulation of counterflow flame using reactingFoam in combustion with grid 50*20*1. [50*20*1-&gt;40*20*1]
- ⑧ BuoyantCavity:  do  a  RANS  simulation  of  buoyantCavity  using  buoyantFoam,  which investigates natural convection in a heat cavity with a temperature difference of 15K is maintained  between  the  hot  and  cold;  the  remaining  patches  are  treated  as  adiabatic. [20-&gt;15]

Table  4  presents  the  performance  test  results  of  MetaOpenFOAM  on  the  original  dataset (dataset1)  and  the  modified  dataset  (dataset2).  It  was  found  that  the  two  datasets  show  similar performance in terms of Executability and pass@1, indicating that MetaOpenFOAM can identify and modify key parameters in the input for key data that can be directly modified, achieving similar performance as the original dataset.

Figure 7 displays the executability of each case before and after modification. The differences between dataset1 and dataset2 are minimal for most cases, except for SquareBendLiq, which shows a significant difference. This discrepancy arises because the user requirements for SquareBendLiq demand  a  longer  simulation  time.  During  this  extended  simulation  time,  the  case  encountered convergence issues, resulting in an Executability of 2 and a pass@1 of 0.

Table  4.  Performance  of  MetaOpenFOAM  in  two  different  datasets  (dataset1:  original  dataset, dataset2: modified dataset)

| Statistical Index                              |   Dataset1 |   Dataset2 |
|------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|
| (A) Executability                              |        3.6 |        3.7 |
| (B) Cost: Running time (s)                     |      271   |      294   |
| (B) Cost: Iteration (max: 20)                  |        5.7 |        7.2 |
| (B) Cost: Token Usage                          |    44045   |    48416   |
| (C) Code Statistic: Input Files                |       13.7 |       13.5 |
| (C) Code Statistic: Lines per Input File       |       50   |       42   |
| (C) Code Statistic: Total lines of Input Files |      760   |      581   |
| (D) Productivity                               |       67.1 |       79.2 |
| (E) pass@1 (%)                                 |       85   |       85   |

However, for some data that cannot be directly modified in the input, such as Reynolds number, the current version of MetaOpenFOAM cannot directly recognize such data that require secondary calculation.

<!-- image -->

For example, in the HIT case, if the user requests a simulation with Reynolds number at 20, MetaOpenFOAM  cannot  produce  a  simulation  that  meets  user  requirement.  This  issue  is  not insurmountable.  In  the  future,  by  introducing  additional  agents  and  a  comprehensive  library  of functions to convert key parameters to input parameters, MetaOpenFOAM could handle a broader range of CFD simulation tasks.

## B. Failure similarity match

Similarity match, as a part of RAG technology is performed during the "Find similar cases" action by the Architect. However, it may fail to match the most similar case due to the inaccurate user requirement, or the inadequate database, which may not contain similar cases. In such scenarios, both pass@1 and executability are significantly reduced. However, even in these cases, using RAG technology still yields better results than not using it.

For  example,  in  the  lidDrivenCavity  case,  the  most  similar  case  found  in  10  tests  was sloshingCylinder, which clearly does not have a high similarity match. Despite this, shown as in Table 1 and Table 8, the pass@1 60% and executability 2.8 with RAG technology were still much better than without it, whose pass@1 is 0% and executability is 1.0.

## C. Human participation

While MetaOpenFOAM aims to perform successful simulations using natural language inputs alone, for cases with complex geometries and boundary conditions, natural language inputs alone are  insufficient.  Therefore,  human  participation  is  needed  to  enhance  the  performance  of

MetaOpenFOAM. Interfaces have been included in MetaOpenFOAM to handle issues related to complex geometries and boundary conditions.

These  interfaces  allow  for  human  intervention  to  refine  the  simulation  setup,  ensuring  that MetaOpenFOAM can tackle more sophisticated CFD tasks that are beyond the current capabilities of fully automated processes. This combination of automated and human-assisted approaches aims to strike a balance between efficiency and accuracy in CFD simulations.

## 5. Conclusion

For  the  first  time,  an  LLM-based  multi-agent  framework  for  CFD  has  been  established, incorporating the construction of a multi-agent system based on MetaGPT and RAG technology based  on  Langchain.  Specifically,  the  multi-agent  system  consists  of  four  roles:  Architect, InputWriter,  Runner,  and  Reviewer.  These  roles  work  together  by  first  decomposing  the  CFD simulation  task  into  a  series  of  input  file  generation  subtasks  (Architect),  then  generating  the corresponding input files based on the subtasks (InputWriter), running the CFD simulation (Runner), and finally providing feedback to the InputWriter by checking the simulation results (Reviewer) until the results meet expectations or the maximum number of iterations is reached. RAG technology aids this process by converting OpenFOAM tutorials into a database, matching the most similar cases from the database whenever the LLM needs access, thereby assisting the LLM in answering queries.

To test  the  performance of MetaOpenFOAM in CFD simulations, a benchmark for natural language-based CFD solvers was proposed, consisting of eight CFD simulation tasks derived from OpenFOAM tutorials. Tests on the benchmark have shown that MetaOpenFOAM achieved a high pass@1  rate  of  85%,  with  each  test  case  costing  only  $0.22  on  average.  This  demonstrates MetaOpenFOAM's ability to  automate  CFD  simulations  using  only  natural  language  input  and iteratively correct errors to achieve the desired simulation at a low cost.

An ablation study was conducted to verify the roles of each component in the multi-agent system and the RAG technology. The results showed that removing the Reviewer, Action review architecture, and RAG resulted in pass@1 rates of 27.5%, 70%, and 0%, respectively, all lower than the  original  framework's  85%.  This  demonstrates  the  necessity  of  reviewing  results  and  RAG technology. A sensitivity study on the temperature parameter in the LLM showed that compared to middle/high  temperature  (0.5/0.99)  pass@1  rates  of  83%  and  48%,  the  LLM  based  on  low temperature (0.01) has a higher pass@1 rate of 85% on average. This suggests that conservative and coherent generated text leads to more stable and accurate results. However, the middle temperature (0.5) also showed good performance in specific cases.

Additionally,  MetaOpenFOAM  maintained  an  85%  pass@1  rate  even  after  modifying keywords in the prompts, indicating its ability to identify and modify key parameters in the input corresponding to the keywords. The performance on failure similarity matches also showed that MetaOpenFOAM has good simulation capability even when the most similar case is not matched. Finally,  incorporating human participation can enhance the performance of MetaOpenFOAM in handling  issues  related  to  complex  geometries  and  boundary  conditions.  These  three  aspects demonstrate that MetaOpenFOAM possesses a certain degree of generalization ability.

## Appendix B. OpenFOAM database

The OpenFOAM database is derived from the tutorials in the main OpenFOAM directory and is primarily divided into three sub-databases: foamfile architecture, foamfile context, and allrun files. Different sub-databases are used based on the specific action being performed. Below are some excerpts:

Sub-database foamfile architecture:

```
###case begin: case name: pitzDaily case domain: compressible case category: LES case solver: rhoPimpleFoam case input name:['fvSolution', 'fvSchemes', 'fvConstraints', 'controlDict', 'momentumTransport', 'physicalProperties', 'nut', 'k', 'T', 'p', 'alphat', 'U', 'muTilda'] corresponding input folder:{'fvSolution': 'system', 'fvSchemes': 'system', 'fvConstraints': 'system', 'controlDict': 'system', 'momentumTransport': 'constant', 'physicalProperties': 'constant', 'nut': '0', 'k': '0', 'T': '0', 'p': '0', 'alphat': '0', 'U': '0', 'muTilda': '0'} case end.###

## Appendix C. DNS HIT complete flowchart

In this section, we use the HIT (Homogeneous Isotropic Turbulence) example to demonstrate the  basic  workflow  of  MetaOpenFOAM. The  corresponding  user  requirement  is  to  "do  a  DNS simulation  of  incompressible  forcing  homogeneous  isotropic  turbulence  with  Grid  32^3  using dnsFoam."

In this user requirement, we provide the case description, category, solver, model, and grid information, while omitting details such as boundary conditions, initial conditions, run time, and time steps. This approach aligns with typical user practices.

First,  based  on  the  user  requirement,  the Architect  converts  it  into  a  standardized  format, including case name, case domain, case category, and case solver. Then, it searches the database for the most similar case, retrieves its file architecture, and writes a new file architecture suitable for the  current  case  based  on  the  similar  case's  architecture  and  user  requirements.  This  new  file architecture is divided into multiple subtasks and passed to the InputWriter. It is important to note that each file to be generated in the architecture corresponds to a subtask.

Figure 8. Sketch of Action Create input architecture in HIT case

<!-- image -->

Next,  the  InputWriter  uses  the  information  provided  by  the Architect,  along  with  the  file information from the similar case in the database, to write the input files for each subtask. Once all subtasks are completed, the work is passed to the Runner. The Runner writes an Allrun file suitable for the current requirement based on the Allrun file information from the similar case in the database and executes it in the OpenFOAM environment. If there are no errors and the Executability &gt;= 3, the loop exits. However, when executing the HIT example, an error "No 'neighbourPatch' provided" was encountered. Therefore, the Runner passes this error information to the Reviewer for correction.

Figure 9. Sketch of the first iteration using MetaOpenFOAM in HIT case

<!-- image -->

The Reviewer first determines whether the error is related to the file architecture or the file content. In  the  HIT  example,  the  Reviewer  identifies  the  error  as  being  related  to  the  content  of  the blockMeshDict  file,  so  it  is  returned  to  the  InputWriter  for  modification.  This  entire  process

## constitutes the first iteration.

Figure 10. Sketch of the second iteration using MetaOpenFOAM in HIT case

<!-- image -->

The Runner then continues to execute the modified input files but encounters a new error: "cannot find patchField entry for cyclic periodic\_x\_half0," and passes this to the Reviewer. The Reviewer  determines  that  the  issue  lies  with  the  content  of  the  U.orig  file,  so  it  instructs  the InputWriter  to  rewrite  U.orig. The  Runner  then  runs  the  simulation  again,  ultimately  achieving successful execution of the HIT example with Executability = 4.

Where  "Prompt  Tokens"  refer  to  the  tokens  required  for  the  prompts  sent  to  the  LLM,  while "Completion  Tokens"  are  the  tokens  needed  for  the  LLM's  responses.  In  MetaOpenFOAM,  Prompt Tokens are often more numerous than Completion Tokens. This trend becomes more pronounced with an  increasing  number  of  iterations.  This  is  because  identifying  the  cause  of  errors  necessitates transmitting all input files to the LLM. The more iterations there are, the more frequently the input files are transmitted, resulting in a higher number of Prompt Tokens compared to Completion Tokens.
